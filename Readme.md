# Kickstarter Outcomes Based on Goals

## Overview of Project
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize outcomes of kickstarter campaigns relevant to Louise's campaign based on the month of their launch dates and their funding goals. 


## Analysis and Challenges 
I performed my analysis on the theater kickstarter outcomes based on launch date by creating a pivot table to display all months in which theater kickstarters were started and separated all campaigns by their outcomes: successful, failed, and canceled. I then used a line chart to easily visualize the data. 

To perform the analysis on outcomes based on goals I created buckets of goal amounts ranging from 1000 or less to 50000 or more and filtered the data again by outcome. I then found the percentage successful, failed, and canceled to create another line chart for visualization.

I encountered a small challenge because the criteria outlined by the assignment were different for the two analyses. The first deliverable used the Theater parent category but the second deliverable used the plays subcategory. I initially assumed that all criteria would be the same and miscalculated my data. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Most successful campaigns are launched in May with 111 successful campaigns followed by June with 100 successful campaigns. Failed campaigns are also highest in May through July but the number of failed campaigns are relatively steady throughout the year with a low of 31 in November and a high of 52 in May. December campaign launches are the lease successful with 37 successful and 35 unsuccessful. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Roughly, campaigns with smaller goals are more likely to be successful than campaigns with higher goals. Campaigns with goals over $45000 are very unlikely to succeed and campaigns under $5000 are highly likely to succeed. Interestingly, campaigns in the range of $35000 to 44999 are more likely to succeed than campaigns in the $15000 to 39999 range despite having bigger goals. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Campaigns launched in the early summer are out likely to succeed. December is not a good time to launch a campaign. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Campaigns below $10000 and between $35000 to $44999 are mostly likely to succeed. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data set is small and outdated, ranging from 2014-2017. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could analyze the data by months and year to see if there was a difference in the outcomes of campaigns over time. We could also compare the success of theater and plays campaigns vs campaigns in other categories.
